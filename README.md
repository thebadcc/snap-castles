**How to Guide**

Step 1. Upload your image. Note, the image is processed on the browser, not stored by myself, and only used for purposes of generating the import. Makes sure you've resized it to 32x32 pixels. [You can resize a .png file with this tool.](https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png?width=32&height=32&ratio=true)
